# Web-Blog-Post: Kevin Zhang

## The Website was built through DJango, a Python Web Framework, that allows seamless customization, data authorization, and design. This website was built to store and keep my accomplishments throughout the years for others to see my journey as a programmer! Here you can find information about my skills and how they have evolved as I continue to learn!

### Link to the Website:

## Quick Guide:

### Make sure that DJango is installed:

```
python -m pip install Django
```

### Then migrate the 'manage.py' file:

```

```
